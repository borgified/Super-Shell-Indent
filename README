This is a shell indentation script that calculates the indent level based on begin/end syntax pairs, as opposed to complex conditionals and pattern matching.

This script also introduces indentation for:

           case blocks 
           paren blocks
           '[[' blocks
           line continuation

It's slower than the stock indentation, but IMHO, it doesn the "right" thing much more often.  :)
